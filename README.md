**metaldb** is a document-oriented persistent storage.
Under the hood, MerkleDB uses RocksDB as a key-value storage.

## Features

- Supports list, map and set collections (aka *indexes*),
  as well as singular elements.
  Further, indexes can be organized into groups, allowing to create
  hierarchies of documents with arbitrary nesting.
- Ability to define data layouts in an intuitive, declarative format.
- Basic support of transactions: changes to the storage can be
  aggregated into a fork and then merged to the database atomically.
- Access control leveraging the Rust type system, allowing to precisely
  define access privileges for different actors.
- First-class support of long-running, fault-tolerant data migrations
  running concurrently with other I/O to the storage.

## Usage

Include `metaldb` as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
metaldb = "1.0.0"
```

## History notice

metaldb was initially created as [MerkleDB](https://github.com/exonum/exonum/tree/master/components/merkledb)
by [Exonum](https://exonum.com/index).

MerkleDB was initially created to support merkelized collections atop the persistent key-value storage.
This project does not have the same purpose: instead, it provides a generic convenient and (ideally) backend-agnostic interface for the persistent NoSQL storage, without any bounds to the blockchain specifics.
